CS124 - algorithms

CS164 - Operating Systems

I am taking the course right now through edx, which has a Discuss board. Not sure if you have access to that, but here is the list of courses that were suggested by one of the course's staff members for those that have completed the class and are looking for more. This list is expansive and varying, so hopefully there should be something on here that interests you. As for the other comment, I've always found Team Treehouse to be a good resource - I've used them for web programming lectures and have learned a lot, but it's not a free resource.
